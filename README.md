## [Emerging Markets â€“ short-term risks and long-term opportunities](https://github.com/pmikov/Emerging-Markets---Risks-Opportunities/blob/master/EM%20Risks%20%26%20Opportunities.ipynb)
Identifying short-term risks and long-term opportunities across Emerging Market economies

Completed on 28th of August as a final project for "Data Science" course at Software University (June - August 2020)
- course 2 of 4 of "Artificial Intelligence" specialization

### The project consists of the following chapters:
1. Introduction
2. Data Selection - selecting group of factors for evaluating: 
   - Macro Stability (risk of economic crisis) 
   - External Vulnerability (risk of Balance of Payments crisis)
   - Institutional Strength
   - Long-term Economic Growth
3. Data Acquistion and cleaning -  more than 30 economic & political indicators are acquired from 7 different official data sources by:
   - connecting to official APIs of DBnomics and United Nations
   - connecting to online Excel databases on World Justice Project and IMF websites
   - using BeautifulSoup for web-scrapping websites of The Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC), Freedom House and CEIC
4. Combining all data into one dataframe - formatting the data and dealing with missing values
5. Data Transformation - performing and comparing three methods of rescaling data:
   - Z-score standardization
   - min-max normalization 
   - quantile transformation into UPD
6. Deriving the Final Scores and Visualizations - methods deployed:
   - bar and scatter plot charts with annotations and conditional formatting using matplotlib & seaborn libraries
   - conditional formatting on DataFrames
   - visualizations by MultiIndex slicing
   - world map using Basemap library
7. Conclusion & Further Research
